I discuss the emergence of AI powered tooling which proof-read emails before they are sent and flag content which could later be used as evidence in competition law cases. I argue that the use of AI in this manner could harm competition enforcement efforts, but that it doesn’t have to be that way. AI could be used in a manner commensurate with both the public and private interest.

          I’m featured on the Shaping Competition in the Digital Age podcast with Anush Ganesh and Kena Zheng.
Talking about, among other things, how I got into competition law from being a software engineer, how there really is no excuse for dominant undertakings designing internet platforms to be anti-competitive, and the need for conceptual clarity in competition law. The content of the episode draws from my preprint about Gen AI &amp; Article 102 TFEU.

The European Commission has struggled to tackle excessive prices in Europe, despite evidence of how they arise in relation to market power. We argue that adopting accounting and financial analysis as part of its toolkit can enable the Commission to understand and act when firms are exploiting their market power.

On May 20th 2025, the European Commission and the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) agreed on a competition cooperation agreement, an important milestone in the evolving relationship between the EU and the UK in competition enforcement, which became institutionally more complex as a result of Brexit. This post introduces the content of the Agreement, compares it to the pre-Brexit scenario as well as to other similar agreements that the Parties have signed, and provides an analysis.

Democracy in Europe is under threat. Competition law, given its history and potential as a tool of anti-domination, is a natural fit to protect and revitalise democracy in Europe. Yet the protection of democracy is habitually said to fall outside the proper scope of competition enforcement. Spencer Cohen and I, drawing from a paper that we published in JCLE, to show how competition law can, through a recalibration of its error cost framework, be used to safeguard against economic domination in markets.

The UK’s withdrawal from the European Union put European competition policy in a somewhat awkward state. The schism left EU and UK competition law as geographical neighbours and almost identical twins in both legal form and substance, yet worlds apart in terms of their ability to coordinate. This blog post considers the impact of a potential competition agreement between the UK and the EU with regards to helping remedy this somewhat unfortunate sitaution.

Big Tech firms degrade our information environment, both within and beyond the boundaries of their platforms. Dominant firms describe themselves as providing walled gardens which are safe and secure, and claim to invest heavily in combating problematic content. Yet aside from scandals suggesting otherwise, there is reason to be sceptical. Inflammatory and addictive content drives levels of engagement and, thus advertising revenue on platforms.
